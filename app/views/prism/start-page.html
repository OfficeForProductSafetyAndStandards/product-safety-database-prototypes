      Determine and evaluate the level of risk presented by a consumer product
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body-l">
      The assessment is part of the recently introduced Product Safety Risk Assessment Methodology (PRISM) and intended for organisations responsible for market surveillance and enforcement.
    </p>

    <p>Although PRISM is primarily aimed at evaluating the risks associated with non-food consumer goods, regulatory bodies in charge of other product categories may also find it beneficial, either in whole or in part.</p>

    <p>You can find the PRISM guide, case studies and statistical data sets to support your risk assessments
 on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-safety-risk-assessment-methodology-prism" target="_blank"> guidance page</a>. The explanation of OPSS terminology concerned with risk and risk-related matters can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opss-risk-lexicon" target="_blank">OPSS risk lexicon page</a>.  </p>

      <p> Use this service to:</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li><a href="triage-guidance">Risk triage</a> to determine whether the product needs a full safety risk assessment.</li>
        <li>Search for products on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-safety-support-for-local-authorities" target="_blank">Product Safety Database (PSD)</a>.</li>
