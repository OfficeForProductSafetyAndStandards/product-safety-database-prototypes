      Determine and evaluate the level of risk presented by a consumer product
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body-l">
      The assessment will be undertaken using the  recently introduced Product Safety Risk Assessment Methodology (PRISM) which is intended for use by organisations responsible for market surveillance and enforcement.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>Although PRISM is primarily aimed at assessing and evaluating the risks associated with general non-food consumer goods, regulatory bodies in charge of other types of products may also find it beneficial, either in whole or in part.</p> -->

    <p>You can find the PRISM guide, examples of risk assessments and statistical data sets to support your risk assessments
 on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/product-safety-risk-assessment-methodology-prism" target="_blank"> PRISM guidance page</a>. An explanation of OPSS terminology concerned with risk and risk-related matters can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/opss-risk-lexicon" target="_blank">OPSS risk lexicon page</a>.  </p>

      <!-- <p> In some circumstances it may not be possible to obtain all of the information listed here and the risk assessment will need to proceed on the basis of the information available at the time.</p> -->

      <p>You will need:</p>

        <li> Product Safety Database (PSD) login credentials - weâ€™ll ask you to sign in or <a href="#">request a new account</a> before starting the full risk assessment.</li>
        <li> Information about the product, including details of the manufacturer/supplier, number of products sold, and other information accompanying the product.</li>
        <li>Details of safety concerns associated with the product including number and nature of hazards.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Also, the following information is likely to be useful and relevant in many circumstances:

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-padding-bottom-4">

        <li>Product test reports.</li>
         <li>Any relevant research studies, statistical data sets or other evidence to indicate the probability of harm ocurring and the nature of the harm.</li>
        <li>Any risk assessments that have been undertaken previously for the type of product being assessed or, for
closely related products.</li>
