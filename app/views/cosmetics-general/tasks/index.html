                        Q: There is another thing to consider in removing nanomaterials this time. I think it should not be possible to remove nano if its already used in component. Not sure we are thinking about such case

                        A: I think we've already considered this. I think if a user removes a Nanomaterial that has already been used in a component it is removed from the component.
But I think I should update the page design for the 'Select which nanomaterial to remove' so that each nanomaterial in the list shows which components it is already included in. (If none, then obviously we don't show any components with each nanomaterial).
And in the 'Select which nanomaterial to remove' page (if nanomaterials have already been included in components) we also state that "you" (the user) can re-run any component/item task again to include Nanomaterials in them (and any nanomaterials which aren't listed must first be added either via the Add nanomaterials link, or via the first task).
Also, on a slightly separate note, on the final review draft page, if any nanomaterials are orphaned (and are not include in any component) a big error message at the top of the page will inform the user that they first need to remove the orphaned nanomaterial before they can Approve and submit (the button is missing here).

                            This is a revised version of the nanomaterials question now in task 1. As the user completes task 1 they are asked here about nanomaterials and, if yes, how many. But they are also able to choose 'Don't know'. (This was agreed with Nasir to avoid users dropping out of the task if they didn't know the nanomaterials answer.

                            In task 1, where the user is asked "Does the product contain nanomaterials?" And they can answer Yes (+ quantity), No or Don't know. If they answer 'Don't know' the user continues with the standard user-flow, but when they are eventually returned back to the Task list page, there is task 1 (completed) and a new task 2 displaying:  "About nanomaterials". This new task 2 gives the user a chance to source the answers. But they must do task 2 before they can continue).

                            From task 2 (the About nanomaterials task) the user goes to this page (with only two options and a Cancel link).
