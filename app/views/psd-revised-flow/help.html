        <p class="govuk-body">
            A case records case specific information. In the Product Safety Database (<abbr>PSD</abbr>), information about a case and a product are seperate. Information about a product is recorded as a product record and you include a product record in your case.

                    <li>Because a product record only describes the product - and not information about a case - it can be reused in many different cases and cases which might be reporting different safety concerns</li>
                    <li>You may need to create your own version of a product record if an existing one doesn't fit your needs (or one doesn't already exist for your product)</li>
                    <li>Because the same product record should be used by all users creating cases about the same product, it is important that editing is controlled: At any one time only one team can edit a product record - as the product record owner - but any team can ask the product record owner to add additional information if required</li>
                    <li>You can remove a product record from your case at any time and add a different one to your case if necessary</li>
