        <p class="govuk-body">
            A case records case specific information about an unsafe, or non-compliant, product. 
            
            Case specific information might include the business address for the importer of the product or risk assessments about the product. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the Product Safety Database (<abbr>PSD</abbr>), information about a case and a product are seperate. Information which describes the product is recorded as a product record and you add the product record to your case.

            About product records
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            A product record only records information about a product. For example, its name, its barcode number and photographs of the product. It does not include information about safety concerns or incidents relating to the product because that is case specific information.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            A product record can be added to more than one case. Teams from across the country can create cases and add the same product record to their cases. 
        </p> 
        
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            A product record describing a counterfeit version of a product should be a different product record to one describing the genuine product. 
        </p>  
        
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            While several product records might accidently describe the same product, we aim to have only one product record in the Product Safety Database describing a product. 
        </p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            You can create your own product record if an existing one doesn't fit your needs or one doesn't already exist for your product
