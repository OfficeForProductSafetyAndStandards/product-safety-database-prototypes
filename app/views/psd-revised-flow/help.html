            About product records
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record only records and includes information about a product. For example, its name, its barcode
            number and photographs of the product. It does not include information about safety concerns or incidents
            relating to the product because that is case specific information.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record can be included in more than one case. Teams from across the country can create cases from
            the same product record or add it to their cases.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record describing a counterfeit version of a product should be a different product record to one
            describing the genuine product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            While several product records might accidently describe the same product, we aim to have only one product
            record in the Product Safety Database describing a product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            You can create a new product record if one doesn't already exist for your product or if an existing one
            doesn't fit your needs.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A case records case specific information about an unsafe, or non-compliant, product.

            For example, case specific information might include the business address for the importer of the product or
            risk assessments about the product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the Product Safety Database (<abbr>PSD</abbr>), information about a case and a product are seperate.
            Information which describes a product is recorded as a product record and is available to be included as
            part of a case.

                they may have been resolved</li>

            <li>The product records will have improved information and detail</li>
            <li>By using the same product records across different teams and cases nationally, there is greater
                transparency, and you are able to share information or even avoid duplicating work</li>
            <li>There will be fewer duplications of product entries in the database and searching for products will be
                more decisive</li>
            <li>This will allow us to add more powerful features in the future.</li>
