                        Because the current business pages have a mixture of edit pages - this makes it diffcult to utilise in the cases page: The main 'Edit this business' link and the 'business page' links simply go directly to the relevant business page. The attachments and cases links also do so, but with the hash attachments or cases appended to the URL (to open the correct tab on landing). (Note "cases" is plural differs from x1 statement). By definition - currently - a business has to be included in one case, so if the number is 1, we use the plain text statement (as illustrated).

On Businesses page change the tab text "Full details" to "Main details". 5. Attachments seems to only be able to upload images?

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Closing a case - timestamped records</h3>

                <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="/psd-revised-flow/case-page-closed" target="_blank">Case page closed</a>
                <br><span class="govuk-!-font-size-16">A version showing a closed case with a timestamped product. <br>(You can only view a timestamped product record via a case page)</span>.
                <br><span class="govuk-!-font-size-16">All edit (add/edit/change/set, etc) options removed through the entire case (including supporting pages - not exampled in this prototype), except for the two 'Re-open' links on the case landing page. If a case is closed, the status row uses a black tag highlight block to display 'Case closed'. The date the case was closed is shown next to the black tag (we record the date cases are closed). "Add a product to the case" and all equivalent links (top right, on all the related case pages) are removed. The statement below the main H1 title is changed to "This case is closed". 
                    <br><br>  
                    The product record included is now a "timestamped" version and so no edit links or links to the full product page are included (which is demonstrated via the Products link). The <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="/psd-revised-flow/products-timestamped" target="_blank">Products page now uses an alternative text</a> with the <abbr>PSD</abbr> reference number and a new <abbr>PSD</abbr> ref number, which here appends a "now" timestamp (as like the javascript funciton date.now) to give the record a unique reference. (The case closed date is included in this text). Opening and closing the case does not update the product record - it can't change - only a different product record that might have been added while the case was re-opened can be affected. No edits of any kind can now be made to this timestamped version of the product record and it can never be removed from the case, even if the case is re-opened (so the remove product link is also removed). This product record, by default, will not be included in other cases, so the Cases tab is set to (0) and it will be empty. The entire row (with updated date and image) below the H3 product title) is removed. 

                    <br><br>  <strong>Important:</strong> the links linking to supporting information go to the relevant page to display the full details but these destination pages for <b>closed</b> cases should also not include the "Edit" (or similar) links. This is also true for the Businesses destination pages (and on the new case Businesses page itself we change the link text of "To view and edit all the details ..." to "To view all the details..." ). <b>HOWEVER</b>, we don't NEED to include this functionality as it doesn't currently exist in the live service for closed cases so we can look to review this in the future?
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Note:</strong> When a case is closed the product record is timestamped and a copy is made - this includes copies of any "Attachments" assets. The 'Attachments' tab in the products page then updates its attachment <abbr>URL</abbr> links to simply point directly to the new saved file asset copies themselves and not to the supporting attachments section in the original product page.
