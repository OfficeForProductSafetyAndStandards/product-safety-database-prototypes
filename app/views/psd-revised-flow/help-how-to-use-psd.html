                Previously, when a case was created, basic information describing a product was automatically required and formed part of the <abbr>PSD</abbr> case. Instead, cases now include &ndash; or link to &ndash; product records. It is the product record which now records the basic information about the product.

                Cases record information about allegations, evidence, and corrective actions. A product record describes the product and is included within a case.

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="content-01">Overview</h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            The two main areas within the <abbr>PSD</abbr> online service are the cases area and the products area. These are accessed using the main navigation menu (towards the top<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">/start</span> of each page).
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">cases area</span> you can find cases you or your team have created or search the entire database of cases. A case is what ultimately reports unsafe, noncompliant and serious risk products to <span title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</span>/<abbr title="Office for Product Safety and Standards">OPSS</abbr> and includes relevant information such as importer contact details, product batch numbers, test reports and corrective actions.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When a case is created, information and assets (such as accidents or incidents, reports and evidence images) can be added directly to the case. But the basic information describing a product is added to a case by including a product record. A product record is what contains the basic information about the product.
        </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            The basic information about a product is added to a case by including a product record. In the <abbr>PSD</abbr> a case and a product record are two seperate entities.
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">products area</span> you can find the product records which are included in your cases or search the entire database of product records. A product record only contains information about a product and doesn't include case information. A single product record can be included within many cases.

            2. Create a case
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            The process of creating a case starts from a product record. A case needs to include &ndash; or link to &ndash; at least one product record. This is made easy by first searching for a product within the products area.
        </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number govuk-list--spaced">
                <li>In the products area, search for a product using the 'All products &ndash; Search' option<a href="#findproduct" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state govuk-link--no-underline opss-secondary-text"><sup class="opss-font-size-14">*</sup></a></li>

            <sup id="findproduct">*</sup>If a product record describing the product does not already exist, you can create a new product record for the product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When you have finished the process of creating a case, the product record will automatically be included within the new case. The new case can be found in the cases area, where you can <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">continue adding further information and assets to the case</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When you create a case, you and your team are the case owners.

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In the cases area, the secondary navigation menu <span class="opss-remove-from-desktop">(on the left)</span> provides three ways to find a case:

        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            You can apply filters to search results to reduce how many product records are returned in a search.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Select a case name in any list to open the main case page for the case.

            4. Edit or close a case
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When you view a case the secondary navigation menu <span class="opss-remove-from-desktop">(on the left)</span> presents the case information in logical groups and across different pages. If you are a member of the team which owns the case, or you have been granted editing permission, the case pages provide 'edit', 'add', 'remove' or 'change' options throughout all the pages relating to the case.
        </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You cannot edit or close a case if you do not have editing permission for the case.

        <p class="govuk-body">
            On the main case page for a case, the team which owns the case can add other teams to the case and grant them editing permission. (Select 'Change' in the 'Teams added' row).
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            If your team owns the case, or you have editing permission, you can <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold opss-no-wrap">close a case</span> by selecting the 'Close case' option on the main case page for a case.

            About product records
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record only records and includes information about a product. For example, its name, its barcode
            number and photographs of the product. It does not include information about safety concerns or incidents
            relating to the product because that is case specific information.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record can be included in more than one case. Teams from across the country can create cases from
            the same product record or add it to their cases.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record describing a counterfeit version of a product should be a different product record to one
            describing the genuine product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            While several product records might accidently describe the same product, we aim to have only one product
            record in the Product Safety Database describing a product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            You can create a new product record if one doesn't already exist for your product or if an existing one
            doesn't fit your needs.

            A case records case specific information about an unsafe, or non-compliant, product.
