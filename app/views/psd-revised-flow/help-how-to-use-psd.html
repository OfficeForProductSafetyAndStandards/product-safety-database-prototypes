            The two main areas within the <abbr>PSD</abbr> online service are the cases area and the products area. These are accessed using the main navigation menu (towards the top<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">/start</span> of each page).
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">cases area</span> you can find cases you or your team have created or search the entire database of cases. A case is what ultimately reports unsafe, noncompliant and serious risk products to <!--span title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</span>/-->the <abbr title="Office for Product Safety and Standards">OPSS</abbr> and includes relevant information such as importer contact details, product batch numbers, test reports and corrective actions.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When a case is created, information and assets (such as accidents or incidents, reports and evidence images) can then be added directly to the case. But the basic information describing a product is added to a case by including a product record. A product record is what contains the basic information about the product.

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">products area</span> you can find the product records which are included in your cases or search the entire database of product records. A product record only contains information about a product (such as its brand name and model name, barcode, and its catagorisation) and doesn't include case information. A single product record can be included within many cases.

        <p class="govuk-body">
            The process of creating a case starts from a product record. A case needs to include at least one product record. This is made easy by first searching for a product within the products area.

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When you have finished the process of creating a case, the product record will automatically be included within the new case. The new case can be found in the cases area, where you can <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">continue adding further information and assets to the case</span>.

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Once your case has been created you can add more product records to the same case. One example for why you might do this could involve a scenario where a manufacturer has created two or more versions of the <em>same</em>&nbsp; product using different names and barcodes. These products would be represented by different product records, but you could add them all to the same case.

            8. Find a product record
        </h3>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p class="govuk-body">
                In the products area, the secondary navigation menu <span class="opss-keep-for-desktop">(on the left)</span> provides three ways to find a product record:
            </p>

            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number govuk-list--spaced">
                <li>'Your products' lists all the product records included in <!--, or linked to, -->your open cases</li>
                <li>'Team products' lists all the product records included in your team's open cases</li>
                <li>'All cases &ndash; Search' is where you can search all product records currently available in the <abbr>PSD</abbr></li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        </figure>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            You can also search for cases by using the product record details using the 'All cases &ndash; Search' page in the cases area. This can return all the cases which include, or have included, the product record; even if the original product record is no longer available.
        </p>

            9. Viewing product record information
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            When you view a product record the secondary navigation menu <span class="opss-keep-for-desktop">(on the left)</span> presents the product information in logical groups<!-- and across different pages-->.
        </p>

        <figure class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-5 opss-keep-for-desktop">
            <img src="../public/images/help_product-left-nav.gif" class="opss-border-all" alt="What the individual product record left navigation looks like">

            </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            The images added to a product record are images of the product and its packaging and are not case evidence images (which are added to cases).
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            The cases section of a product record lists all the cases which have included the product record.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Which team currently owns and has editing permission for the product record is also displayed. Any team can still include the product record within their own cases.
        </p>

        <!--p class="govuk-body">
            If a product record is not included within an open case for 18 months, the product record is retired and will no longer appear in product record searches.
        </p-->

            10. Edit a product record
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Only one team has editing permission for a product record at any one time. This is to avoid conflicting edits which may compromise the product record.
        </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If you have editing permission, select the 'Edit the product record' option on the product record page to make edits and changes in the form provided (and save your changes).
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            Some information in a product record &ndash; such as the product name &ndash; is permanent. This is to avoid product records changing beyond recognition and compromising any cases which include it. If the changes you require are significantly different then this may necessitate creating a new product record. (You should avoid editing a product record in order for it to represent a different product).
        </p>

        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p class="govuk-body">
                You can add and remove product records from your cases.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you have additional information about a product or more product images, you can source the contact details for the team which currently owns the product record from a product record page.
