                In early 2023 &ndash; How cases work and are created was changed
            </h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Previously, when a case was created, basic information describing a product was automatically required and formed part of the <abbr>PSD</abbr> case. Instead, cases now include &ndash; or link to &ndash; product records. It is the product record which now records the basic information about the product.

            <div class="govuk-inset-text">
                A case and a product are now two separate <br class="opss-br-desktop">entities within the <abbr>PSD</abbr>.

            <p class="govuk-body">
                Cases record information about allegations, evidence, and corrective actions. A product record describes the product and is included within a case. The same product record can now be included within many different cases.

                The two main areas within the <abbr>PSD</abbr> online service are the cases area and the products area. These are accessed using the main navigation menu (towards the top<span class="govuk-visually-hidden">/start</span> of each page).
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                In the <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">cases area</span> you can find cases you or your team have created or search the entire database of all cases. A case is what reports unsafe, noncompliant and serious risk products to <span title="Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy">BEIS</span> and includes relevant information such as importer contact details, product batch numbers, test reports and corrective actions.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                When a case is created, information and assets (such as accidents or incidents, reports and evidence images) can be directly added to the case. But the basic information describing a product is added to a case by including a product record. A product record is what contains the basic information about the product.

                In the <span class="govuk-!-font-weight-bold">products area</span> you can find the product records which are included in your cases or search the entire database of all product records. A product record only contains information about a product and doesn't include case information. A single product record can be included within many cases.
            </p>

            <p class="govuk-body">
                When you view a product record you can see all the cases which have included it.

                A case will need to include &ndash; or link to &ndash; at least one product record. This is made easy by first searching for the product within the products area. When you find it, select the 'Create a new case for this product' option, which will begin the process of creating a case and will automatically include the product record within it. If a product record describing the product does not already exist, then you can create a product record.

            About product records
        </h3>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record only records and includes information about a product. For example, its name, its barcode
            number and photographs of the product. It does not include information about safety concerns or incidents
            relating to the product because that is case specific information.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record can be included in more than one case. Teams from across the country can create cases from
            the same product record or add it to their cases.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A product record describing a counterfeit version of a product should be a different product record to one
            describing the genuine product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            While several product records might accidently describe the same product, we aim to have only one product
            record in the Product Safety Database describing a product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            You can create a new product record if one doesn't already exist for your product or if an existing one
            doesn't fit your needs.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            A case records case specific information about an unsafe, or non-compliant, product.

            For example, case specific information might include the business address for the importer of the product or
            risk assessments about the product.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            In the Product Safety Database (<abbr>PSD</abbr>), information about a case and a product are seperate.
            Information which describes a product is recorded as a product record and is available to be included as
            part of a case.
